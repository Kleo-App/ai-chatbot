# Database Migration Notes

## How to Run Migrations for the AI Chatbot Project

The proper way to run migrations for this project is to use the built-in npm
scripts:

1. **Generate migrations** based on schema changes:

   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   ```

   This creates SQL migration files in `lib/db/migrations/`.

2. **Push migrations** to the database:

   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

   This applies the schema changes directly to the database.

3. If you need to check the database schema:

   ```bash
   npm run db:check
   ```

4. For more advanced operations, you can use the database studio:
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```

## UserProfile Migration

The UserProfile table was successfully created by running:

```bash
npm run db:generate  # Generated the migration file
npm run db:push      # Applied the changes to the database
```

The UserProfile table is defined in `lib/db/schema-profile.ts` and is properly
referenced in `lib/db/schema.ts`.

## Environment Variables

Make sure the `.env` file contains the proper `POSTGRES_URL` for database
connections.
